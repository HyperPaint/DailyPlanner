	<!--About the program-->
	<string name = "textabout"> The Diary application was created during summer practice. This application allows you to organize a list of tasks and record a variety of entries. Each task has urgency and importance. These options are used for efficient presentation in the task list. Also, tasks and notes contain a title and description, date, and more. Tasks have four buttons - View, Run, Edit, Delete. Notes can be pinned. They have three buttons - view, edit, delete. </string>
